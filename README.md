SnowRide is a mobile application geared towards winter sports enthusiasts, like skiers and snowboarders who want to get insights and keep records for their rides.

The repo consists in a mobile application that allows the user to record video and sensors data with an iPhone, the goal is to give the user an overlay for the video with the data from the sensors and an easy way to track the history of rides with detailed information for each ride.

In the overlay, it will be presented the meteorology and temperature from an API if the user has internet access, based on the current location (GPS), Instant speed, G-Force and Altitude from the available sensors in the iPhone. The user can record the data for a ride without record the video, the data and videos recorded will be shown on a history page, on the history page, the user can track records, check his progress, view graphical information about each record, reproduce the videos and share the records on social media.

In the settings page will be possible to define what overlay data the user wants to record and check which are the available sensors for his smartphone.
